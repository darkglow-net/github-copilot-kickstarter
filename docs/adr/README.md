# Architecture Decision Records

Lightweight records capturing the *why* behind significant decisions in the workspace-baseline project.

## Index

## Template

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title** — Short descriptive name
2. **Status** — Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
3. **Context** — What prompted the decision
4. **Decision** — What was decided
5. **Consequences** — Trade-offs and implications
